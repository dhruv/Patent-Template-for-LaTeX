'make utility' at the command line.


WRITING YOUR PATENT SPEC:
-------------------------

Only the files under the 'config' directory are not intended to be modified.


DRAWINGS:
---------

Drawings are quite easy to do, just follow the basic guidelines in the
USPTO's `Guide to Filing A Non-Provisional (Utility) Patent Application'. 
Basically, drawing with black ink or computer, use only that ink for all
shading (no grey, use dots or lines for shading), use zebra stripes for
cross sections, make all numbers and letters legibly large, and make the
line going from each number or letter to the feature clear and unambiguous.


SUPPORT/WARRANTY:
-----------------

There is no support or warranty provided for the use of this template. 
The authors wrote it because using LaTeX for filing patent applications is a
natural fit - and providing it to the public is a nice thing to do.
